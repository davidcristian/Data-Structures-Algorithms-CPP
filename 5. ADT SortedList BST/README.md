# Binary Search Tree
Implement the given container (ADT) in C++ using a given representation and a binary search tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library.

Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), implement the container directly!

### 15. ADT SortedList
 - Using a BST with linked representation with dynamic allocation. Every node of the BST will retain the number of elements to the left of the node as well.
