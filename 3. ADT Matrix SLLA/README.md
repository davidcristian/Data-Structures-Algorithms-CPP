# Linked List on Array
Implement the  given container (ADT) in C++ using a given representation and a linked list on array as a data structure. You are not allowed to use the vectoror list from STL or from any other library.

### 1. ADT Matrix
 - Represented as a sparse matrix, using a SLLA (singly linked list simulated using arrays and array indexes without the explicit use of pointers or memory addresses) with <line, column, value> triplets (value â‰  0), ordered lexicographically considering the line and column of every element.
